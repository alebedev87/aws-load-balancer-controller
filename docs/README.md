## AWS LoadBalancer Controller

AWS LoadBalancer Controller is a controller to help manage Elastic Load Balancers for a Kubernetes cluster.

  - It satisfies Kubernetes [Ingress resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) by provisioning [Application Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html).
  - It satisfies Kubernetes [Service resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) by provisioning
[Network Load Balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html).

This project was formerly known as "AWS ALB Ingress Controller", we rebranded it to be "AWS LoadBalancer Controller".

  - AWS ALB Ingress Controller was originated by [Ticketmaster](https://github.com/ticketmaster) and [CoreOS](https://github.com/coreos) as part of Ticketmaster's move to AWS and CoreOS Tectonic. Learn more about Ticketmaster's Kubernetes initiative from Justin Dean's video at [Tectonic Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqXVKneP0Hg).

  - AWS ALB Ingress Controller was donated to Kubernetes SIG-AWS to allow AWS, CoreOS, Ticketmaster and other SIG-AWS contributors to officially maintain the project. SIG-AWS reached this consensus on June 1, 2018.
